# Titanic-ggplot2-exercise
# review of exercise:
# first ggplot - straight forward, easy to put together.
# 2nd ggplot - the function of facet_grid is useful. The function gives a good side-by-side matrix view of the Pclass vs survival rate.
# 3rd ggplot - the geom_bar is quicker and easier to digest, yet the geom_point gives that extra information (Age) in the "y" axis, if needed.
